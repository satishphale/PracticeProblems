with the benefit of the results reported in the PNAS manuscript.After considering the findings of fact and the record as a whole for this proceeding, I propose these conclusions of law to the debarring official for use in reaching a decision on the proposal to debar Dr. C.A.Ex. 206. These booklets describe expected ethical standards for scientific research and contain entries that pertain to the standards which I have concluded apply and were violated here. For example, these booklets discuss plagiarism, treatment of research data, and use of privileged data. These materials are cited further below. It was undisputed that these materials would be generally accepted as authority by the scientific research community and that they reflect standards of conduct that would have been accepted in 1986, the time at issue here.In reaching my conclusions about the accepted standards of conduct relevant to this case, I also relied on the testimony of the scientists appearing as witnesses in this case. I further relied on the standards of conduct stated as conclusions of law in a prior debarment decision, Decision and Findings of Fact for the Proposed Debarments of Robert Edward McCaa, Ph.d., DAB No. 823 (1987). As I noted in that prior case, standards of conduct for scientific research are continually evolving and there may be some areas of regional variation or personal discretion. I have been able to discern, however, certain fundamental principles common to the scientific community as a whole. The standards for handling peer reviewed manuscripts and for reporting scientific research that are stated in these conclusions reflect these fundamental principles. I have evaluated my findings concerning Dr. Bridges' conduct against these standards and concluded that Dr. Bridges violated these standards of conduct as described below.I would say within a few days to a week, and the variation would be -- appear to be more likely related to the time when they finally got the manuscript and looked at it and said, oh, my goodness, this is a conflict, I can't do this and then send it right back.The other scientists' testimony was consistent with Dr. Bradshaw's concerning the handling of peer reviewed material and the speedy action taken to decline to review where there is a conflict. There was, however, recognition that a scientist might actually "peek inside and see what the guy found . . . but . . . just send the thing right back."Tr. 1451 (Dr. Goldberg). Dr. Goldberg stated that a conflicting manuscript should be returned within twenty-four hours so that peer review would not be delayed and to avoid a conflict of interest. Tr.Special care must be taken when dealing with unpublished materials belonging to others, especially . . . papers seen or heard prior to publication or public disclosure. Such privileged material must not be exploited . . . Scientists also must be extremely careful not to delay publication or deny support to work that they find to be competitive . . .While there was some disagreement among the scientific experts about whether it was appropriate even to continue to read a manuscript once it was identified as closely related to the reviewer's own work, the experts agreed with the booklets' statements on standards of conduct that any information obtained from the manuscript must be treated as confidential and privileged, that is, that it would be unethical to appropriate research methods as one's own.Conclusion of with the benefit of the results reported in the PNAS manuscript.After considering the findings of fact and the record as a whole for this proceeding, I propose these conclusions of law to the debarring official for use in reaching a decision on the proposal to debar Dr. C.A.Ex. 206.
